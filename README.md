What is it?
-----------

AntiShare is a plugin designed to target Creative Mode players and stop them from dominating your server.

Check out the [BukkitDev page](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/antishare) or the [Bukkit Forum post](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/56523) for more information such as commands.

Enterprise Operation
-----

AntiShare is designed for high-profile servers (or servers with lots of players). This is to enhance the server's ability to operate without having to worry about creative mode players. AntiShare can still be run on smaller servers, but those servers will not see a significant gain from the performance enhancements within AntiShare.
